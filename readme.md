Penn Manor Laptop Cart Binder Covers
==============

About the code
--------------
The binder covers are written in TeX, so as to preserve formatting and file
compatibilty across devices and platforms.

Please refer to [the Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) for more information.

To Compile
--------------
Simply clone the repository and run the TeX compilier for your system.
Compliling the *main.tex* file will create all of the necessary pages.

For Linux, pdflatex is preferred.

Edit the main.tex file to include the preferred pages (Cart1, Cart2, etc)

After making any changes run:

	pdflatex main.tex

**A pre-compliled PDF is already generated for quick use**

Uploading changes
----------------
Any additions for extra 'title pages' are welcome.

When uploading changes, please be sure to include an updated version of the main.pdf file.
